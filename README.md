## üåü Features

This repository showcases the power of **self-supervised learning (SSL)** for hematological cell classification. With SSL, you can enjoy:

1. üîç **Meaningful Feature Extraction**: Extract valuable features from cell images **without needing any class labels**!
2. üîÑ **Efficient Knowledge Transfer**: Seamlessly transfer knowledge between **bone marrow** and **blood cell** domains.
3. üìä **Easy Adaptation**: Adapt your models to new datasets with **minimal labeled data**!

## Results

This study highlights the power of self-supervised learning (SSL) for hematological cell classification and cross-domain adaptation with minimal labeled data. For the Matek blood dataset, our SSL model trained on bone marrow cells achieved state-of-the-art results, showing that direct model transfer is possible without dataset-specific training. For the other datasets, we achieved **state-of-the-art results** with significantly fewer labels and much less computational power. The results are shown in the figure below, which displays **balanced accuracy** for the domain adaptation experiments as a function of the number of samples per class used for classifier fitting. The data covers three blood datasets and various ML classifiers: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression (LR)**, and **k-nearest neighbours (KNN)**. The **SSL feature extractor**, trained on the Matek BM dataset, remained the same throughout. The **benchmark line** represents the accuracy reported in the original dataset-specific publications using supervised end-to-end deep learning.

The two-dimensional embedding of Acevedo blood cell images, computed using UMAP, shows clear clustering of the eight cell classes. These features were extracted using the **SSL model** trained on the **Matek bone marrow dataset** without class labels. This demonstrates that **SSL training on bm effectively captures general cell features of blood cells**, even across different staining and scanning conditions.

The following figure shows the **attention heads** of an **SSL-trained (a)** and a **supervised-trained (b)** bone marrow model on a representative cell image. It is evident that the **SSL feature extractor** effectively focuses on the cell, capturing essential features, while the **supervised model** directs its focus to less relevant areas, indicating potential **overfitting** to the training dataset.

#### Experiment Overview üî¨

We conducted several experiments, which can also be replicated using the provided `eval_ssl.py` script. The **SSL feature extractor** was trained on the **Matek BM dataset**, and based on the extracted features, lightweight ML classifiers were trained. Two types of experiments were performed:

1. **Direct Model Transfer**: Using the features from the BM dataset.
2. **Domain Adaptation**: Using a small amount of labeled data from the target dataset.

The classification performance was then evaluated using the test data of the target datasets.
